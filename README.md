# Flask_personalwebsite


Using Flask for building a personal website. During the process, I followed a Udemy course on Python to build fundamentals of the website. I will improve the website with adding CSS and JS. To run the code, you might need to install XAMP Server in order to deal with database issues and of course Flask.
